## Why SVP?

Current AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot) operate at the **text/code level**, leading to:

- **Context overflow**: AI chokes on large codebases, unable to maintain coherent understanding across thousands of files
- **Destructive edits**: AI "fixes" often break carefully crafted human logic, introducing subtle bugs
- **Architecture drift**: No semantic guardrails—system structure gradually erodes into spaghetti code
- **Review nightmare**: Humans must audit thousands of lines of generated code, defeating the purpose of AI assistance

**The root cause**: AI is working at the wrong abstraction layer. It's like trying to understand a novel by analyzing individual ink molecules.

> Just as humans don't write machine code, AI shouldn't directly manipulate source code.

SVP introduces **Layered Compilation**—a classic software engineering approach adapted for the AI age:

```
Intent (L5) → Architecture (L4) → Logic (L3) → Skeleton (L2) → Code (L1)
     ↑                                                            ↓
  Humans design                                               AI compiles
```

**Core principle**: The upper layers are the **source of truth**; lower layers are **derived artifacts**. When you need to change something, edit the upper layers and recompile—not the generated code. This mirrors how we treat compiled binaries: you don't patch the binary, you modify the source and rebuild.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

### The Layered Compilation Model

SVP transforms software engineering from "writing code directly" to "designing at abstraction layers, compiled by AI":

```
Intent (L5) → Architecture (L4) → Logic (L3) → Skeleton (L2) → Implementation (L1)
     ↑                                                                       ↓
  Humans design                                                          AI compiles
```

**Key Principles**:
- Humans edit only **L5-L3** (Intent, Architecture, Logic)
- AI compiles **L3 → L1** (Runnable code)
- **Recompile over modify** — Changes in upper layers trigger regeneration of lower layers

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install CLI
npm install -g @semanticvoxelprotocol/cli

# 2. Create a project
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
svp init

# 3. Define your intent
vim blueprint.svp.yaml

# 4. Compile (using AI)
svp compile --level 5 --ai
svp compile --level 4 --ai
svp compile --level 3 --ai
svp build

# 5. Run
npm run build
npm start
```

## 🏗️ Five-Layer Architecture

| Layer | Name | Edited By | Content |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| **L5** | Blueprint | Humans | Project intent, domain boundaries, constraints |
| **L4** | Logic Chain | Human-reviewed | Business processes, module interfaces |
| **L3** | Logic Block | Human-reviewed | Pseudocode, contracts, algorithms |
| **L2** | Code Block | AI-generated | Code skeletons, placeholders |
| **L1** | Code | AI-generated | Full runnable code |

**The Golden Rule**: Edit L3 → Recompile → New code. **Never directly modify L1.**

## 🔮 Vision

> **Make AI a compiler, not an editor.**

Humans define problems, design architecture, and establish contracts. AI compiles designs into code.
